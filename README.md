# next steps for project development
When implementing a project with file sets like these, I recommend including a README file like the one right here to display the project title and a little information about the project. Some example potential things to include in such a project are below. (And it is always good to include the URL to your live, deployed project site for easy access!)

Project Title
(subtitle, if one exists)

your name/byline

Abstract or short description of your project.

URL Links to your project site and to your code repo for easy access to them via the ReadMe.

A description of the context of your project and your approach to project development. This will be specific to your own process, but might include any of the following examples: reasons why you chose your topic/project, external links, inspiration for your project, additional detail about your interest in the topic beyond what your project captures, design notes/drawings/screen shots/moodboards/wordbanks/etc. documenting your project development process, and/or screencaptures of your project in process. The purpose of this section is to give the viewer a sense of your project development process.

Data / Sources:
If you project is based on data, you should specify those sources.

References/external acknowledgements (these should also be listed on your project site itself)

... And anything someone from the public interested in your project will want to know
